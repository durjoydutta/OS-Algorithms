# Operating System Algorithms Collection

Welcome to the **OS Algorithms Collection** repository! This collection features various Operating System (OS) algorithms implemented in C and C++. Each algorithm is organized into folders based on its category, covering essential OS topics such as scheduling, disk scheduling, page replacement, memory allocation, and deadlock detection/avoidance algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Scheduling**  
  Contains different process scheduling algorithms, including:
  - First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Priority Scheduling
  - Multilevel Queue Scheduling

- **Disk Scheduling**  
  Features algorithms to optimize disk access time, including:
  - FCFS Disk Scheduling
  - Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
  - SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
  - C-SCAN
  - LOOK
  - C-LOOK

- **Page Replacement**  
  Algorithms to manage page replacement in memory, including:
  - First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
  - Least Recently Used (LRU)

- **Memory Allocation**  
  Algorithms for efficient memory allocation in systems, including:
  - First Fit
  - Best Fit

- **Deadlock Algorithms**  
  Contains algorithms to detect or avoid deadlocks, including:
  - Banker's Algorithm (Deadlock Avoidance)
  - Deadlock Detection with Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)
